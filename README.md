# ArithmeticKnutsonIndex
This repo contains the complementary code to the paper "Arithmetic Properties of Character Degrees and the Generalised Knutson Index" arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12408. It contains code to compute the Knutson Index of the Symmetric and Alternating groups and to compute the integer sequences A363675, A363676 and A363701 on the OEIS.

To run: Download and open the .ipynb files on a Jupyter notebook and run with a Sagemath kernel.
